# CLAHE

- This folder contains the supplementary code to my article [Contrast Enhancement Algorithms](https://iq.opengenus.org/contrast-enhancement-algorithms/) on OpenGenus IQ.

- Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization(CLAHE) differs from adaptive histogram equalization in its contrast limiting.

- In the case of CLAHE, the contrast limiting procedure is applied to each neighborhood from which a transformation function is derived. 

- For Histogram Equalization of color images you have to convert the BGR image to a color space like YCrCb.

- The image before and after CLAHE are shown below:
