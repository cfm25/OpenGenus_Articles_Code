# Bayesian Belief Networks

- This folder contains the supplementary code to my article [Bayesian Belief Networks](https://iq.opengenus.org/bayesian-belief-networks/) on OpenGenus IQ.

- Bayesian Belief Networks are simple, graphical notation for conditional independence assertions. Bayesian Belief Networks in Python can be defined using pgmpy and pyMC3 libraries. Below mentioned are the steps to creating a BBN and doing inference on the network using pgmpy.

- The network represented is originally mentioned in [Bayesian Artificial Intelligence](https://bayesian-intelligence.com/publications/bai/book/BAI_Chapter2.pdf) and is described below:
